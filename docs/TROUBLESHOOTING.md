# Troubleshooting

Address common issues and troubleshooting tips:

- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.

- Verify the ROS environment is sourced properly.
  
- Check for hardware compatibility issues, especially with NVIDIA or Intel graphics for Docker setups.

- Ensure that all required nodes and libraries are installed. If any nodes are missing, install them using npm:
  ```bash
  cd ~/.node-red
  npm install <node-package-name>
  ```

For further assistance, consult the ROS and NODE-Red community forums and the official TIAGo++ tutorials available [here](REFERENCES.md).
