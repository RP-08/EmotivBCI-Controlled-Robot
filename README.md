# EmotivBCI-Controlled-Robot
This project focuses on developing a BCI-controlled robotic assistant using the TIAGo++ robot parallel gripper from PAL Robotics for object grasping tasks. By leveraging Emotiv's Epoch+ headset, I aim to enable intuitive control of robotic grasping through mental commands, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in assistive robotics.
